<h2>INTRODUCCIÓN</h2>
<p>The term seed may refer to a stage in the life cycle of a flowering plant, but it also points us to the result of sexual reproduction; therefore, the seed plays a vital role not only in the life cycle of plants, but also in agriculture and commerce.</p>
<p>
 For the purposes of this practice, it is important to mention that the term seed is not, in all cases, botanically accurate; that is, it is not used in the sense of a mature and fertilized ovule, but rather refers to the unit of dissemination in seed crops, regardless of whether it is a true seed, a fruit, or some other structure.

## Characteristics of seeds

<p>
Considering the requirements of plants and the needs of humans, seeds have certain important characteristics:
</p>

* <strong> <a href="#BioInvestigaciones/parte2.html"> Resistance to unfavorable conditions.</a> </strong>
This is what allows species to survive under severe drought or periods of intense cold, which would kill the plant itself. Seeds can be stored during winter or any other unfavorable season and be used when conditions become appropriate.

* <strong> Small and resistant to handling. </strong>
These characteristics allow seeds to be easily dispersed by wind, water, and animals, making it possible for plants to colonize new areas. Their easy handling facilitates transportation and allows their development in the most favorable regions, as well as their distribution to other agricultural areas.Their easy handling facilitates transportation and allows their development in the most favorable regions, as well as their distribution to other agricultural areas. Seeds contain an embryo with stored nutrients. The new plant that grows from the embryo is nourished by these reserves until it is large enough to produce its own food. Additionally, these reserves in seeds are used as a source of human food.

* <strong> They can be produced in very large quantities. </strong>
This helps ensure their survival from one year to the next and from one place to another.

* <strong>They contain the plants genetic codes.</strong>
These codes ensure that species continue without major changes from one generation to another, and this allows new varieties to be developed, multiplied, and distributed. Varieties can be produced identical to the original type through certification schemes.

## Variability in Seeds

The extensive variability that exists in seeds is undeniable. Regarding external variation, it may occur in size, shape, color, and surface.
